Here's another way to use the numbers [4, 43, 17] to create an equation that equals 30:

<answer> (43 - 17) + 4 = 30 </answer>

First, subtract 17 from 43: 43 - 17 = 26
Then, add 4: 26 + 4 = 30
So the equation is (43 - 17) + 4 = 30, and the answer is 30.

ðŸ¤– Output: <think>Here's how we can create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers [4, 43, 17]. First, we need to find a way to get the first part of the equation, x, to equal the desired result. Since we are left with only one number, 30, we need to find a way to get it through the equation without repeating any numbers. We can start with the number 4, as it is the smallest and most basic number. If we add it to 43, we get 47. Then, if we subtract 17 from 47, we get 30, which is the desired result. So, the equation would be 47 - 17 = 30. </think>

Now, let's put it all together in a final equation and answer:

So, the final equation and answer are (4 + 43) - 17 = 30. :)
