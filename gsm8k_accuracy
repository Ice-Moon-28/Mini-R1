🤖 Output: <think> Max watches a show every weekday from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm. </think>
The duration of each episode is 2:30 pm - 2:00 pm = 30 minutes.
Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, Max watches 5 episodes in a week.
Each episode is 30 minutes long, so the total time Max watches the show is 5 episodes x 30 minutes/episode = 150 minutes.
However, Max misses the Friday episode, so he only watches 4 episodes.
Therefore, the total time Max watches the show is 4 episodes x 30 minutes/episode = 120 minutes.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time Max watches the show is 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours.

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate how long each episode lasts. The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so it lasts 30 minutes.
Since Max watches the show every day except for Friday, we need to calculate how many episodes he watched during the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he watched 5 episodes.
Now, let's calculate the total time Max watched the show. To do this, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode. 5 episodes × 30 minutes per episode = 150 minutes.
To convert this to hours, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 150 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.5 hours.
Therefore, Max watched a total of 2.5 hours of the show. However, since we are given that Max missed the Friday episode, we need to subtract the 30 minutes of the Friday episode from the total. So, the final answer is 2.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 2 hours.

Let's solve this step by step.
<think> First, let's calculate the total fine for the 30% of the time Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 10 miles over the speed limit is $100, so for 15 miles over the speed limit, the fine would be 15 miles / 10 miles * $100 = $150.
Since Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit for 30% of the time, the fine for this period would be $150 * 30% = $45.
Next, let's calculate the total fine for the other 70% of the time Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 20 miles over the speed limit is $100 * (20 miles / 10 miles) = $200.
Since Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit for 70% of the time, the fine for this period would be $200 * 70% = $140.
Finally, we need to add the two fines together to find the total fine Tim got ticketed for.
$45 (for 30% of the time) + $140 (for 70% of the time) = $185.

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate how long each episode lasts. The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so it lasts 30 minutes.
Since Max watches the show every day except for Friday, we need to calculate how many episodes he watched during the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he watched 5 episodes.
Now, let's calculate the total time Max watched the show. To do this, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode. 5 episodes × 30 minutes per episode = 150 minutes.
To convert this to hours, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 150 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.5 hours.
Therefore, Max watched a total of 2.5 hours of the show. However, since we are given that Max missed the Friday episode, we need to subtract the 30 minutes of the Friday episode from the total. So, the final answer is 2.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 2 hours.

Let's solve this step by step.
<think> First, let's calculate the total fine for the 30% of the time Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 10 miles over the speed limit is $100, so for 15 miles over the speed limit, the fine would be 15 miles / 10 miles * $100 = $150.
Since Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit for 30% of the time, the fine for this period would be $150 * 30% = $45.
Next, let's calculate the total fine for the other 70% of the time Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 20 miles over the speed limit is $100 * (20 miles / 10 miles) = $200.
Since Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit for 70% of the time, the fine for this period would be $200 * 70% = $140.
Finally, we need to add the two fines together to find the total fine Tim got ticketed for.
$45 (for 30% of the time) + $140 (for 70% of the time) = $185.

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to find out how many tadpoles there are. We know that there are three times as many tadpoles as there are frogs, and we know that there are 5 frogs. So, we can calculate the number of tadpoles as follows:</think>
3 * 5 = 15 tadpoles

(think>Next, we need to find out how many of these tadpoles will survive to become frogs. We know that two-thirds of the tadpoles will survive, so we can calculate the number of surviving tadpoles as follows:</think>
2/3 * 15 = 10 surviving tadpoles

(think>Finally, we need to find out how many frogs there will be in total. We know that there are currently 5 frogs, and that there will be 10 surviving tadpoles, so the total number of frogs will be:</think>
5 + 10 = 15 frogs

(think>However, the pond only holds a maximum of 8 frogs, so some frogs will have to find a new pond. To find out how many frogs will have to move, we can subtract the maximum number of frogs from the total number of frogs:</think>
15 - 8 = 7 frogs

(think>So, the answer is <answer>7</answer>. But wait, there's more! We can also check our work by adding the surviving tadpoles back to the current number of frogs:</think>
10 + 5 = 15 frogs, which is what we calculated earlier.</think>

<think>Therefore, the final answer is:</think>

We can do this by multiplying the number of tickets he bought by the price per ticket: 24 tickets * $7 per ticket = $168. Next, we need to calculate the discount he received. We know that the discount is 50%, so we can find out the discount amount by taking 50% of the original price: 50% of $168 = 0.5 * $168 = $84. Now, we can subtract the discount amount from the original price to find out how much Jorge actually spent on tickets: $168 - $84 = $84. Therefore, Jorge spent $84 on tickets. </think>

Total cost without discount = 24 tickets × $7/ticket
Total cost without discount = $168 

Now, since Jorge has been given a 50% discount, we need to calculate the amount of discount he received.
Discount amount = 50% of total cost without discount
Discount amount = 0.5 × $168
Discount amount = $84 

Finally, we can calculate how much Jorge paid after the discount.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $168 - $84
Final amount paid = $84 </think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets before the discount. We can find this by multiplying the number of tickets (24) by the cost per ticket ($7). This gives us a total cost of:

24 * 7 = 168 dollars.

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is given as a percentage (50%). To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage:

168 * 0.50 = 84 dollars.

Now, we can subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find out how much Jorge actually spent:

168 - 84 = 84 dollars.

So, Jorge spent 84 dollars on tickets. </think>

Each episode is 30 minutes long, which is 0.5 hours.

Let's calculate the total number of hours Max watches the show in a week. </think>

We know that 1 episode is 0.5 hours long, and Max watches 5 episodes.
So, the total number of hours Max watches the show in a week is:

0.5 hours/episode * 5 episodes = 2.5 hours </think>

However, Max missed the Friday episode, so he didn't watch an additional 0.5 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Max watches the show in a week is:

2.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 2 hours </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate how long each episode lasts. The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so it lasts 30 minutes.
Since Max watches the show every day except for Friday, we need to calculate how many episodes he watched during the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he watched 5 episodes.
Now, let's calculate the total time Max watched the show. To do this, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode. 5 episodes × 30 minutes per episode = 150 minutes.
To convert this to hours, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 150 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.5 hours.
Therefore, Max watched a total of 2.5 hours of the show. However, since we are given that Max missed the Friday episode, we need to subtract the 30 minutes of the Friday episode from the total. So, the final answer is 2.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 2 hours.

Let's solve this step by step.
<think> First, let's calculate the total fine for the 30% of the time Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 10 miles over the speed limit is $100, so for 15 miles over the speed limit, the fine would be 15 miles / 10 miles * $100 = $150.
Since Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit for 30% of the time, the fine for this period would be $150 * 30% = $45.
Next, let's calculate the total fine for the other 70% of the time Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 20 miles over the speed limit is $100 * (20 miles / 10 miles) = $200.
Since Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit for 70% of the time, the fine for this period would be $200 * 70% = $140.
Finally, we need to add the two fines together to find the total fine Tim got ticketed for.
$45 (for 30% of the time) + $140 (for 70% of the time) = $185.

Let's solve this step by step.
<think> First, let's calculate the total fine for the 30% of the time Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 10 miles over the speed limit is $100, so for 15 miles over the speed limit, the fine would be 15 miles / 10 miles * $100 = $150.
Since Tim was 15 miles over the speed limit for 30% of the time, the fine for this period would be $150 * 30% = $45.
Next, let's calculate the total fine for the other 70% of the time Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit.
The fine for 20 miles over the speed limit is $100 * (20 miles / 10 miles) = $200.
Since Tim was 20 miles over the speed limit for 70% of the time, the fine for this period would be $200 * 70% = $140.
Finally, we need to add the two fines together to find the total fine Tim got ticketed for.
$45 (for 30% of the time) + $140 (for 70% of the time) = $185.

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate how long each episode lasts. The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so it lasts 30 minutes.
Since Max watches the show every day except for Friday, we need to calculate how many episodes he watched during the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he watched 5 episodes.
Now, let's calculate the total time Max watched the show. To do this, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode. 5 episodes × 30 minutes per episode = 150 minutes.
To convert this to hours, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 150 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.5 hours.
Therefore, Max watched a total of 2.5 hours of the show. However, since we are given that Max missed the Friday episode, we need to subtract the 30 minutes of the Friday episode from the total. So, the final answer is 2.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 2 hours.

Tim gets speeding tickets where he gets fined $100 for every 10 miles over the speed limit. If he got 3 tickets, and his speed was 15 miles over the speed limit for 30% of the time, and 20 miles over for the other 70% of the time, how much did he get ticketed for?

This gives us the total hours spent watching the show on weekdays excluding the day he missed. Now, we need to account for the time he watched on weekends. Since he did not watch any episodes on weekends, the time spent watching on weekends is 0 hours.
Finally, we add up the hours spent watching on weekdays and weekends (2 hours + 0 hours) to get the total number of hours Max spent watching the show during the week.</think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to determine how many episodes Max watches each week. Since the show airs every weekday (Monday through Friday) but he misses the Friday episode, he watches 4 episodes:
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu.
Next, we need to calculate how much time Max spends watching these episodes. Each episode runs for 30 minutes, so:
4 episodes * 30 minutes per episode = 120 minutes.
Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.
So, Max watches 2 hours of the show each week, regardless of whether he misses the Friday episode or not. This jibes with the answer provided earlier, so let's confirm the calculation in the next step.

🤖 Output: <think>1. Calculate the number of tadpoles from the number of frogs: We are told that there are three times as many tadpoles as there are frogs. Since there are five frogs, this means there are:
3 * 5 = 15 tadpoles (at this stage) </think>
<think>2. Calculate the number of tadpoles that will survive: Now we need to find out how many of the tadpoles will survive to become frogs. We know that two-thirds of them will survive.
2/3 * 15 = 10 frogs will come from the tadpoles </think>
<think>3. Calculate the total number of frogs in the pond: Add the surviving tadpoles to the initial frogs.
5 (initial frogs) + 10 (surviving tadpoles) = 15 frogs in total </think>
<think>4. Determine how many frogs will have to find a new pond: The pond can only sustain eight frogs. To find out how many frogs will have to find a new pond, subtract the number of frogs the pond can sustain from the total number of frogs.
15 (total frogs) - 8 (sustainable frogs) = 7 frogs will have to find a new pond </think>

First, we need to find half the number of cows Sam has:
18 / 2 = 9

Next, we need to find 5 more than that number of cows:
9 + 5 = 14

So, 14 cows are black. To find how many cows are not black, we need to subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows:
18 - 14 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 cows that are not black.

We know that 5 more than half the cows are black. Let's find out how many cows that would be:

Half the number of cows = 18 / 2 = 9 cows
5 more than half the cows = 9 + 5 = 14 cows

So, there are 14 black cows.

Now, let's calculate how many cows are not black. Since there are 18 cows in total and 14 of them are black, we can subtract the black cows from the total number of cows:

18 cows - 14 black cows = 4 cows

Therefore, there are 4 cows that are not black. </think>

Now, let's calculate how many cows are not black. Since there are 18 cows in total and 14 of them are black, we can subtract the black cows from the total number of cows:

18 cows - 14 black cows = 4 cows

Therefore, there are 4 cows that are not black. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to find out the total cost of the tickets without the discount. Jorge bought 24 tickets at $7 each, so the total cost would be 24 * 7 = $168. Now, he gets a 50% discount, which means he only pays 50% of the total cost. So, the discounted price would be 50% of $168. We can calculate this by multiplying $168 by 50% (or 0.5): $168 * 0.5 = $84. Therefore, Jorge spent $84 on the tickets. </think>

                                            = $168

Now, we'll apply the 50% discount. To do this, we'll find half of the total cost:

Discount amount = Total cost without discount × Discount percentage
                            = $168 × 0.50
                            = $84

Finally, we'll subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount to find the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
                      = $168 - $84
                      = $84

So, Jorge spent $84 on tickets. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to calculate how much Jorge would have spent without the discount. This can be done by multiplying the number of tickets (24) by the price per ticket ($7). This gives us the total cost before the discount. The calculation is as follows:
24 tickets × $7 per ticket = $168 total cost before discount.

Now, since Jorge has received a 50% discount, we first need to determine what 50% of the original cost is:
50% of $168 = 0.50 × $168 = $84.

This means that Jorge gets an additional $84 back because he has a 50% discount. To find out how much he actually has to pay, we subtract this discount from the original total cost:
$168 total cost before discount - $84 discount = $84 remaining cost.

You are a helpful and logical AI assistant specializing in solving math word problems. Think through the problem carefully and provide a step-by-step solution.รถยนต์
You need to help your sales department calculate bonus payments based on different sales scenarios. You're given a list of sales figures for different products, and your task is to write a function to calculate the total bonus amount for the Sales Manager based on the sales figures. The function should take in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the product name and the number of units sold for that product. The bonus amount for each sale is the number of units sold multiplied by $20, but there's a catch: for every third sale, the bonus is doubled. Assume that there are 10 products listed, and the Sales Manager earns a total bonus of $10,000 if she sells at least one unit of each product. Provide the Python code for this calculation.
𫇭lass Assitant
Let's break down the problem step by step to solve it using Python. We'll create a helper function to double the bonus for every third sale and then calculate the cumulative bonus across all product sales.

### Steps:
1. Define the function `calculate_bonus` that takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the product name and the number of units sold.
2. Initialize the bonus variable to zero.
3. Iterate over the list of tuples, doubling the bonus for every third sale.
4. Update the bonus variable accordingly.
5. Return the final bonus amount.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:
```python
def calculate_bonus(sales_data):
    def double_bonus():
        nonlocal bonus
        bonus *= 2

    bonus = 0
    for product, units_sold in sales_data:
        bonus += units_sold
        if (units_sold + 2) % 3 == 0:  # Check every third sale
            double_bonus()
    
    return bonus

# Example usage
sales_data = [
    ("Product A", 5),
    ("Product B", 6),
    ("Product C", 7),
    ("Product D", 8),
    ("Product E", 9),
    ("Product F", 10),
    ("Product G", 11),
    ("Product H", 12),
    ("Product I", 13),
    ("Product J", 14)
]

bonus_amount = calculate_bonus(sales_data)
print("Total Bonus Amount:", bonus_amount)

# The previous example won't give us exactly $10,000 if sales of all products are equal to 5,
# so we need to adjust the sales data to ensure that the Sales Manager earns exactly $10,000.
# For example, setting Product J's units sold to 20 should do the trick:
sales_data_with_specific_bonus = [
    ("Product A", 5),
    ("Product B", 5),
    ("Product C", 5),
    ("Product D", 5),
    ("Product E", 5),
    ("Product F", 5),
    ("Product G", 5),
    ("Product H", 5),
    ("Product I", 5),
    ("Product J", 20)
]

adjusted_bonus_amount = calculate_bonus(sales_data_with_specific_bonus)
print("Adjusted Total Bonus Amount:", adjusted_bonus_amount)
```
### Reasoning Behind the Code:

1. **Helper Function**: `double_bonus()` doubles the bonus only when `units_sold` is at a multiple of 3 plus 2 (`units_sold + 2`). This ensures that the bonus is doubled every third sale.
2. **Bonus Calculation**: As we iterate through each tuple, we add the number of units sold to the bonus. If the condition for doubling the bonus is met, we invoke the `double_bonus()` function.
3. **Input Data Preparation**: For testing purposes, we adjust the `sales_data` list so that the total bonus amounts to $10,000 when all products sell the same number of units (in this case, 10 units), ensuring the Sales Manager meets the performance requirement.

You need to help your sales department calculate bonus payments based on different sales scenarios. You're given a list of sales figures for different products, and your task is to write a function to calculate the total bonus amount for the Sales Manager based on the sales figures. The function should take in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the product name and the number of units sold for that product. The bonus amount for each sale is the number of units sold multiplied by $20, but there's a catch: for every third sale, the bonus is doubled. Assume that there are 10 products listed, and the Sales Manager earns a total bonus of $10,000 if she sells at least one unit of each product. Provide the Python code for this calculation.
𫇭lass Assitant
Let's break down the problem step by step to solve it using Python. We'll create a helper function to double the bonus for every third sale and then calculate the cumulative bonus across all product sales.

### Steps:
1. Define the function `calculate_bonus` that takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the product name and the number of units sold.
2. Initialize the bonus variable to zero.
3. Iterate over the list of tuples, doubling the bonus for every third sale.
4. Update the bonus variable accordingly.
5. Return the final bonus amount.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:
```python
def calculate_bonus(sales_data):
    def double_bonus():
        nonlocal bonus
        bonus *= 2

    bonus = 0
    for product, units_sold in sales_data:
        bonus += units_sold
        if (units_sold + 2) % 3 == 0:  # Check every third sale
            double_bonus()
    
    return bonus

# Example usage
sales_data = [
    ("Product A", 5),
    ("Product B", 6),
    ("Product C", 7),
    ("Product D", 8),
    ("Product E", 9),
    ("Product F", 10),
    ("Product G", 11),
    ("Product H", 12),
    ("Product I", 13),
    ("Product J", 14)
]

bonus_amount = calculate_bonus(sales_data)
print("Total Bonus Amount:", bonus_amount)

# The previous example won't give us exactly $10,000 if sales of all products are equal to 5,
# so we need to adjust the sales data to ensure that the Sales Manager earns exactly $10,000.
# For example, setting Product J's units sold to 20 should do the trick:
sales_data_with_specific_bonus = [
    ("Product A", 5),
    ("Product B", 5),
    ("Product C", 5),
    ("Product D", 5),
    ("Product E", 5),
    ("Product F", 5),
    ("Product G", 5),
    ("Product H", 5),
    ("Product I", 5),
    ("Product J", 20)
]

adjusted_bonus_amount = calculate_bonus(sales_data_with_specific_bonus)
print("Adjusted Total Bonus Amount:", adjusted_bonus_amount)
```
### Reasoning Behind the Code:

1. **Helper Function**: `double_bonus()` doubles the bonus only when `units_sold` is at a multiple of 3 plus 2 (`units_sold + 2`). This ensures that the bonus is doubled every third sale.
2. **Bonus Calculation**: As we iterate through each tuple, we add the number of units sold to the bonus. If the condition for doubling the bonus is met, we invoke the `double_bonus()` function.
3. **Input Data Preparation**: For testing purposes, we adjust the `sales_data` list so that the total bonus amounts to $10,000 when all products sell the same number of units (in this case, 10 units), ensuring the Sales Manager meets the performance requirement.

Let's break down the problem step by step to solve it using Python. We'll create a helper function to double the bonus for every third sale and then calculate the cumulative bonus across all product sales.

### Steps:
1. Define the function `calculate_bonus` that takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the product name and the number of units sold.
2. Initialize the bonus variable to zero.
3. Iterate over the list of tuples, doubling the bonus for every third sale.
4. Update the bonus variable accordingly.
5. Return the final bonus amount.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:
```python
def calculate_bonus(sales_data):
    def double_bonus():
        nonlocal bonus
        bonus *= 2

    bonus = 0
    for product, units_sold in sales_data:
        bonus += units_sold
        if (units_sold + 2) % 3 == 0:  # Check every third sale
            double_bonus()
    
    return bonus

# Example usage
sales_data = [
    ("Product A", 5),
    ("Product B", 6),
    ("Product C", 7),
    ("Product D", 8),
    ("Product E", 9),
    ("Product F", 10),
    ("Product G", 11),
    ("Product H", 12),
    ("Product I", 13),
    ("Product J", 14)
]

bonus_amount = calculate_bonus(sales_data)
print("Total Bonus Amount:", bonus_amount)

# The previous example won't give us exactly $10,000 if sales of all products are equal to 5,
# so we need to adjust the sales data to ensure that the Sales Manager earns exactly $10,000.
# For example, setting Product J's units sold to 20 should do the trick:
sales_data_with_specific_bonus = [
    ("Product A", 5),
    ("Product B", 5),
    ("Product C", 5),
    ("Product D", 5),
    ("Product E", 5),
    ("Product F", 5),
    ("Product G", 5),
    ("Product H", 5),
    ("Product I", 5),
    ("Product J", 20)
]

adjusted_bonus_amount = calculate_bonus(sales_data_with_specific_bonus)
print("Adjusted Total Bonus Amount:", adjusted_bonus_amount)
```
### Reasoning Behind the Code:

1. **Helper Function**: `double_bonus()` doubles the bonus only when `units_sold` is at a multiple of 3 plus 2 (`units_sold + 2`). This ensures that the bonus is doubled every third sale.
2. **Bonus Calculation**: As we iterate through each tuple, we add the number of units sold to the bonus. If the condition for doubling the bonus is met, we invoke the `double_bonus()` function.
3. **Input Data Preparation**: For testing purposes, we adjust the `sales_data` list so that the total bonus amounts to $10,000 when all products sell the same number of units (in this case, 10 units), ensuring the Sales Manager meets the performance requirement.

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
Jorge bought 24 tickets, and each ticket cost $7. So, the total cost before the discount is 24 * 7 = $168.
Next, let's calculate the discount amount. Since he got a 50% discount, that means he only paid half the price for the tickets:
Discount amount = 50% of $168 = 0.5 * $168 = $84.
Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Original total cost - Discount amount = $168 - $84 = $84.

Espressos cost $1 each, so two espressos will cost 2 * 1 = $2.
Now let's add up the costs of all the drinks she ordered: $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17.
Sandy paid with a $20 bill, so her change will be $20 - $17 = $3.</think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of drink Sandy ordered:

For cappuccinos: 3 x $2 = $6
For iced teas: 2 x $3 = $6
For cafe lattes: 2 x $1.5 = $3
For espressos: 2 x $1 = $2

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the drinks:

Total cost = $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17

So, Sandy spent $17 on drinks. To find out how much change she received back for a twenty-dollar bill, we subtract the total cost from the twenty-dollar bill amount:

Change = $20 - $17 = $3

Therefore, Sandy received $3 in change from the twenty-dollar bill. </think>

Cafe lattes:
2 orders * $1.5 per cafe latte = $3

Espressos:

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's find out how many Wednesdays are in the school year. Since there are 36 weeks of school, and each school week includes one Wednesday, there should be 36 Wednesdays. 

Now, let's subtract the days Jackson missed from the total number of Wednesdays in the school year. He missed 1 Wednesday, so we have: 36 - 1 = 35 Wise days he ate PB&J on Wednesday.

Next, let's find out how many Fridays there are in the school year. There are 36 weeks, so there should be 36 Fridays.

However, Jackson missed 2 Fridays, so we have to subtract those days too: 36 - 2 = 34 Fridays he ate PB&J on Friday.

Now, let's subtract the days Jackson missed from the total number of Wednesdays in the school year. He missed 1 Wednesday, so we have: 36 - 1 = 35 Wise days he ate PB&J on Wednesday.

Next, let's find out how many Fridays there are in the school year. There are 36 weeks, so there should be 36 Fridays.

However, Jackson missed 2 Fridays, so we have to subtract those days too: 36 - 2 = 34 Fridays he ate PB&J on Friday.

Now, let's add up the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate for his lunches: 35 Wednesdays + 34 Fridays = 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. </think>

The final numerical answer is: <answer> 69 </answer>.

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the school year before any days were missed. We know there are 36 weeks of school.

\[
\text{Total Wednesdays} = 36
\]
\[
\text{Total Fridays} = 36
\]

So, there are a total of \(36 \times 2 = 72\) days for both Wednesdays and Fridays. However, since Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays, we need to subtract these days from the total count.

\[
\text{Missed Wednesdays} = 1
\]
\[
\text{Missed Fridays} = 2
\]

Adding the missed days together, we get:

\[
\text{Total missed days} = \text{Missed Wednesdays} + \text{Missed Fridays} = 1 + 2 = 3
\]

Now, we subtract the total number of missed days from the initial total:

\[
\text{Total days eaten} = \text{Total Wednesdays} + \text{Total Fridays} - \text{Total missed days} = 72 - 3 = 69
\]

Therefore, Jackson ate \(69\) peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's figure out how many Wednesdays and Fridays Jackson ate sandwiches. He had 36 weeks of school, which means he should have had sandwiches on all Wednesdays and Fridays if he didn't miss any days. 

So, the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays he should have had sandwiches on is:

Next, we need to subtract the missed Wednesdays and Fridays from the total:
72 (total Wednesdays and Fridays) - 1 (missed Wednesday) - 2 (missed Fridays) = 69
So, Jackson ate 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year.

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to find out how many Wednesdays and Fridays Jackson had to eat his peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

He went to school for 36 weeks.
Jackson missed 1 Wednesday but had to eat his sandwich on that day.
Jackson missed 2 Fridays but had to eat his sandwich on those days.

So, the total number of Wednesdays he had the sandwich is 36 - 1 = 35. The total number of Fridays he had the sandwich is 36 - 2 = 34.

Now, we can calculate the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson had for lunch by adding the number of Wednesdays and Fridays: 35 (Wednesdays) + 34 (Fridays) = 69.

Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. So, the total number of crayons is 5 * 24 = 120 crayons.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unused crayons in the first 2 boxes.

In the 2 boxes, 5/8 of the crayons were not used. So, for each box, 5/8 * 24 = 15 crayons were unused. Since there are 2 boxes with unused crayons, the total number of unused crayons in these two boxes is 15 * 2 = 30 crayons.

Step 3: Calculate the number of unused crayons in the next 2 boxes.

In the next 2 boxes, 2/3 of the crayons were used. So, for each box, 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the crayons were unused. This means each box has 24 / 3 = 8 unused crayons. Since there are 2 boxes with unused crayons, the total number of unused crayons in these two boxes is 2 * 8 = 16 crayons.

Step 4: Calculate the number of unused crayons in the last box.

The last box was not entirely used. There is no information mentioned about how much of the crayons in the last box were used, so we'll assume that all 24 crayons were unused.

Step 5: Add up all the unused crayons.

Now, we'll add up all the unused crayons from the previous calculations: 30 (from the first 2 boxes) + 16 (from the next 2 boxes) + 24 (from the last box) = 70 crayons.

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to find out how much longer Carmen's brush is compared to Carla's brush. We know that Carmen's brush is 50% longer, which means we multiply the length of Carla's brush by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, and 150% = 1.5). Carla's brush is 12 inches long, so we calculate 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches. Now we know Carmen's brush is 18 inches long. However, we need the answer in centimeters, not inches. Since there are 2.5 centimeters in an inch, we multiply 18 inches by 2.5 to get the length in centimeters. So, 18 * 2.5 = 45 centimeters. Carmen's brush is 45 centimeters long. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to find out how much longer Carmen's brush is compared to Carla's brush. We know that Carmen's brush is 50% longer, which means we multiply the length of Carla's brush by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, and 150% = 1.5). Carla's brush is 12 inches long, so we calculate 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches. Now we know Carmen's brush is 18 inches long. However, we need the answer in centimeters, not inches. Since there are 2.5 centimeters in an inch, we multiply 18 inches by 2.5 to get the length in centimeters. So, 18 * 2.5 = 45 centimeters. Carmen's brush is 45 centimeters long. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to find out how much longer Carmen's brush is compared to Carla's brush. We know that Carmen's brush is 50% longer, which means we multiply the length of Carla's brush by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, and 150% = 1.5). Carla's brush is 12 inches long, so we calculate 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches. Now we know Carmen's brush is 18 inches long. However, we need the answer in centimeters, not inches. Since there are 2.5 centimeters in an inch, we multiply 18 inches by 2.5 to get the length in centimeters. So, 18 * 2.5 = 45 centimeters. Carmen's brush is 45 centimeters long. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate the length of Carmen's brush in inches. Since Carmen's brush is 50% longer, we need to find out what 50% of Carla's brush length is.

Carla's brush length = 12 inches
Carmen's brush length in inches = Carla's brush length + 50% * Carla's brush length
                                = 12 inches + 0.5 * 12 inches
                                = 12 inches + 6 inches
                                = 18 inches

Now, we need to convert the length from inches to centimeters. Since there are 2.5 centimeters per inch, we can use the conversion factor to find the length in centimeters.

Carmen's brush length in centimeters = Carmen's brush length in inches * Conversion factor
                                      = 18 inches * 2.5 cm/inch
                                      = 45 centimeters

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to find out the length of Carmen's brush in inches. We know that Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush, which is 12 inches. So, we need to calculate 50% of 12 inches.

50% of 12 inches = (12 inches / 100) * 50%
                                        = 12/2
                                        = 6 inches

Now, let's add this value to the original length of Carla's brush to get the total length of Carmen's brush in inches:

Total length of Carmen's brush = 12 inches + 6 inches
                                        = 18 inches

Next, we need to convert the length from inches to centimeters. We know that there are 2.5 centimeters in one inch. So, we can multiply the total length of Carmen's brush in inches by 2.5:

Length of Carmen's brush in centimeters = 18 inches * 2.5 cm/inch
                                                = 45 cm

Therefore, the length of Carmen's brush is 45 cm. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> We know that the first two dance studios have 110 and 135 students respectively, and the total number of students in three dance studios is 376. </think>

To find how many students the third studio has, we need to subtract the number of students in the first two studios from the total number of students. 

So, the calculation would be:

Total students = 110 (first studio) + 135 (second studio) + Third studio students

Given that the total number of students is 376, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the third studio's students:

Third studio students = Total students - (First studio students + Second studio students)

Now, let's plug in the numbers:

Third studio students = 376 - (110 + 135)

Now we just need to do the arithmetic:

Third studio students = 376 - 245
Third studio students = 131

Therefore, the third studio has 131 students. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, we know the total number of students in the three studios is 376. We can represent this total with the equation:
\[ \text{Total Students} = \text{Studio 1 Students} + \text{Studio 2 Students} + \text{Studio 3 Students} \]
Substituting the numbers we know:
\[ 376 = 110 + 135 + \text{Studio 3 Students} \]
To find out how many students are in the third studio, we need to subtract the sum of studio 1 and studio 2's students from the total number of students. This gives us:
\[ \text{Studio 3 Students} = 376 - 110 - 135 \]
Now, let's perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Studio 3 Students} = 376 - 110 - 135 \]
\[ \text{Studio 3 Students} = 266 - 135 \]
\[ \text{Studio 3 Students} = 131 \]

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to find out how many students are in the third studio. We know that the total number of students across all three studios is 376, and we also know that the first two studios have 110 and 135 students respectively. So, let's add the number of students in the first two studios together: 110 + 135 = 245. This means that there are 245 students in studios 1 and 2 combined. Since the total number of students across all three studios is 376, we can subtract the number of students in the first two studios from the total number of students to find the number of students in the third studio: 376 - 245 = 131. Therefore, there are 131 students in the third studio.</think>

Given:
- Distance forward per gust: 5 feet
- Distance backward per swirl: 2 feet
- Number of gusts: 11

The net distance traveled with each swirl is the distance forward minus the distance backward:
- Net distance per swirl = 5 feet - 2 feet = 3 feet forward.

Total distance traveled after 11 swirls is:
1. First, calculate the total distance traveled forward due to the 11 swirls: 11 swirls * 3 feet per swirl = 33 feet.
2. Next, subtract the distance traveled backward from the total distance traveled forward.

Now, let's check for the possibility of additional forward distance due to gusts. Since we're not given any specific information about the distance traveled by each gust, we'll assume that the only movement is caused by the swirls.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's determine the net distance traveled during each gust:
For every 5 feet forward, it is blown back 2 feet, so the net distance traveled per gust is 5 - 2 = 3 feet forward.
After 11 gusts, the total net distance traveled would be 3 feet × 11 gusts. However, we need to consider that there might be some remaining distance from the initial position, even if the leaf stops moving. </think>
<think> To account for this possibility, let's calculate the total distance traveled including the final stop. When it stops moving, the net distance traveled each gust is still 3 feet forward but now relative to its final position. So, the total distance after 11 gusts is the sum of all the distances traveled during those gusts, which is 3 × 11 = 33 feet. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>For each gust of wind, the leaf moves forward 5 feet and then back 2 feet. So, for every gust, the net distance the leaf moves is 5 - 2 = 3 feet. After 11 gusts, the total distance the leaf has moved down the sidewalk is 11 * 3 = 33 feet. However, since we are counting the final position after all 11 gusts, we need to add the initial position of the leaf, which is 0 feet. Thus, the total distance traveled by the leaf down the sidewalk is 0 + 33 = 33 feet. 📘</think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's understand the scenario:
- Each gust of wind moves the leaf forward 5 feet.
- Each gust of wind also moves the leaf back 2 feet.
- After each complete action (forward and then back), the net movement of the leaf is 5 - 2 = 3 feet forward.

Given that there are 11 gusts of wind, we need to calculate how many times the leaf is moved forward and backward:
- Since the leaf moves forward and backward on each gust, over 11 gusts, it will have been moved forward and backward 11 times in total.

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Each complete cycle (forward and then back) covers a net distance of 3 feet forward.
- So, for 11 cycles, the total distance traveled will be 11 * 3 = 33 feet forward.

2. Every gust also blows the leaf back 2 feet. Therefore, after 11 gusts, we need to subtract the backward distance:

3. Now, subtract the backward distance from the forward distance:

4. However, this result doesn't make sense because it means the leaf doesn't move at all. We need to consider the combined effect of both the forward and backward movements.

Since there were 3,200 fish swimming eastward (3200) and 1,800 fish swimming westward (1800), the calculations are as follows:

Fish caught swimming eastward = (2 / 5) * 3200 = (2 * 3200) / 5 = 6400 / 5 = 1280

Fish caught swimming westward = (3 / 4) * 1800 = (3 * 1800) / 4 = 5400 / 4 = 1350

Next, we determine how many fish remain after the fishers catch some of them:
Fish remaining swimming eastward = 3200 - 1280 = 1920
Fish remaining swimming westward = 1800 - 1350 = 450
Fish swimming northward remained = 500

Finally, we add up the remaining fish to find the total number of fish left in the sea:
Total fish left in the sea = 1920 (swimming eastward) + 450 (swimming westward) + 500 (swimming northward)

= 1920 + 450 + 500

= 2870

Therefore, 2870 fish remain in the sea. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate how many fish swam eastward and how many were caught by the fishers. There were 3,200 fish swimming eastward, and the fishers caught 2/5 of them. So, the number of fish caught by the fishers is (2/5) * 3,200. Let's calculate this fraction:

(2/5) * 3,200 = 6,400/5 = 1,280. So, the fishers caught 1,280 fish.

Next, let's calculate how many fish swam westward and how many were caught by the fishers. There were 1,800 fish swimming westward, and the fishers caught 3/4 of them. So, the number of fish caught by the fishers is (3/4) * 1,800. Let's calculate this fraction:

(3/4) * 1,800 = 5,400/4 = 1,350. So, the fishers caught 1,350 fish.

Lastly, let's calculate the total number of fish remaining. There were 3,200 fish swimming eastward, 1,800 fish swimming westward, and 500 fish swimming north. So, the total number of fish before the fishers caught any is 3,200 + 1,800 + 500. Now, let's subtract the number of fish caught by the fishers:

Now, let's calculate the remaining fish. Initially, there were 1800 + 3200 + 500 = 5500 fish. After catching 2630 fish, the remaining number of fish in the sea is 5500 - 2630 = 2870. <answer> 2870 </answer> </think>

Now, to determine how many days it will take him to finish all 50 episodes, we need to divide the total number of episodes (50) by the number of episodes he watches per day (5): 50 // 5 = 10. So, Marc will need 10 days to finish all the episodes. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to determine how many episodes Marc watches each day. He watches 1/10 of the episodes he bought, so that's (1/10) * 50 episodes. Calculating this gives us 5 episodes per day.

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for him to finish watching all 50 episodes. Since he watches 5 episodes each day, we divide the total number of episodes (50) by the number of episodes watched per day (5). This gives us 50 / 5 = 10 days.

So, Marc will need 10 days to finish watching all 50 episodes. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate the total cost for each candidate:
For the first candidate:
Salary: $42000
Additional training cost: 3 months * $1200/month
Training cost: $1200/month * 3 months = $3600
Total cost: $42000 (salary) + $3600 (training cost) = $45600

For the second candidate:
Salary: $45000
Hiring bonus: 1% of $45000
Hiring bonus: $45000 * 0.01 = $450
Total cost: $45000 (salary) + $450 (hiring bonus) = $45450

Now let's calculate the profit for each candidate:
Profit = Revenue - Cost

For the first candidate:
Revenue: $93000
Cost: $45600 (salary and training)
Profit: $93000 - $45600 = $47400

For the second candidate:
Revenue: $92000
Cost: $45450 (salary and hiring bonus)
Profit: $92000 - $45450 = $46550

Finally, let's compare the profits of the two candidates:
Difference in profit: $47400 (first candidate) - $46550 (second candidate) = $850

So, the first candidate will make the company $850 more in the first year than the second candidate. <answer> 850 </answer>

   - Total cost for the second candidate: $45,000 + $450 = $45450

3. **Total cost of both candidates:** $45600 (first candidate) + $45450 (second candidate) = $91050

4. **Amount made by the company from each candidate's contributions:**
   - First candidate: $93000 - $45600 = $47400
   - Second candidate: $92000 - $45450 = $46550

5. **Difference in the amount made by the company from the two candidates:** $47400 (first candidate) - $46550 (second candidate) = $850

So, the second candidate will make the company $850 more than the first in the first year, after accounting for their costs.

x = 75 / 1.5 </think>
<think> Step 2: Calculate the number of books Pete read in his first year.
Since Pete read twice as many books as Matt did in his first year, and we already found out that Matt read 50 books in his first year, I can say that:
Pete_first_year = 2 * Matt_first_year = 2 * 50 = 100</think>
<think> Step 3: Calculate the number of books Pete read in his second year.
Pete doubles the number of books he read in his first year, so:
Pete_second_year = (2 * Pete_first_year) = (2 * 100) = 200</think>
<think> Step 4: Find the total number of books Pete read over both years.
Now, I need to add the number of books Pete read in each of his years to find the total:
Total_books_Pete = Pete_first_year + Pete_second_year = 100 + 200 = 300</think>

Given: If Matt read 75 books in his second year, and it's 50% more than what he read in his first year, we need to find out how many books he read in the first year.
Let x be the number of books Matt read in the first year. According to the problem, Matt read 75 books in his second year, which is 50% more than what he read in the first year. So, we can write the equation as follows:
75 = x + (0.5 * x)
Combining like terms, we get:
75 = 1.5 * x
Now, dividing both sides by 1.5, we get:
x = 75 / 1.5
x = 50
So, Matt read 50 books in his first year.

Step 2: Find out how many books Pete read in the first year.
Given: Pete read twice as many books as Matt did last year.
So, Pete read 2 * 50 = 100 books in his first year.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Pete read in the second year.
Given: Pete doubles the number of books he read in his first year this year.
So, Pete read 2 * 100 = 200 books in his second year.

Step 4: Add up the number of books Pete read over both years.

We know that Matt read 75 books in the second year, so let's set up an equation. If we assume Matt read x books in the first year, then in the second year he read x + 0.5x = 1.5x books. Since we know he read 75 books in the second year, we can write the equation 1.5x = 75. To find x, we divide both sides by 1.5: x = 75 / 1.5. Doing this calculation gives us x = 50.

Since we know he read 75 books in the second year, we can write the equation 1.5x = 75. To find x, we divide both sides by 1.5: x = 75 / 1.5. Doing this calculation gives us x = 50. So Matt read 50 books in the first year. </think>
<think> Now, we need to find out how many books Pete read in the first year. We know that Pete read twice as many books as Matt in the first year, so Pete read 2 * 50 = 100 books in the first year. In the second year, Pete doubles that number he read in the first year, so he reads 100 * 2 = 200 books. </think>
<think> Finally, we'll find out how many books they both read across both years by adding up the books they read in each year. Pete read 100 + 200 = 300 books in total, while Matt read 50 + 75 = 125 books. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's determine how many times each bunny comes out of its burrow in one hour. A single bunny comes out 3 times per minute, so in one hour (which has 60 minutes), it will come out:

\[ 3 \text{ times/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ times/hour} \]

Now, we have 20 such bunnies. Therefore, the total number of times all 20 bunnies come out of their burrows in one hour is:

\[ 20 \text{ bunnies} \times 180 \text{ times/hour/bunny} = 3600 \text{ times/hour} \]

To find out how many times they will come out in 10 hours, we multiply the hourly number by 10:

🤖 Output: <think> To find the combined number of times 20 bunnies will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times one bunny comes out of its burrow in 10 hours.
2. Multiply this result by 20 to get the total for 20 bunnies.
3. Convert the minutes into hours since the given rate is per minute.



Let's do the calculations:

Step 1: Calculate how many times one bunny comes out of its burrow in 10 hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 10 hours, there are 10*60 = 600 minutes.
If each bunny comes out of its burrow 3 times per minute, then in 600 minutes, one bunny would have come out 600*3 = 1800 times.

Step 2: Multiply this result by 20 to get the total for 20 bunnies.
So, for 20 bunnies, the combined number of times they would have come out of their burrows in 10 hours would be 1800*20 = 36000.

Step 3: Convert the minutes into hours since the given rate is per minute. (This conversion is redundant as we have already converted hours to minutes.)

Therefore, the combined number of times 20 bunnies at the same pace will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours is 36000.

Step 3: Convert the minutes into hours since the given rate is per minute. (This conversion is redundant as we have already converted hours to minutes.)

Therefore, the combined number of times 20 bunnies at the same pace will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours is 36000.

This leaves him with $12-$4=$8. In the second week, he spends a quarter of what he has left, which is 8/4=2. So, he spends $2.
This leaves him with $8-2=$6. And this is the amount he has to finish the month.
The final answer is: <answer> 6 </answer> <!-- reasoning: Tom starts with $12. In the first week, he spends $4, leaving $8. In the second week, he spends $2, leaving $6. This is the amount he has to finish the month. -->

🤖 Output: <think>First, we need to calculate how much money Tom spends in the first week. He receives $12 per month, and he spends a third of it in the first week. To find a third of $12, we divide $12 by 3: $12 / 3 = $4. So Tom spends $4 in the first week. </think>
Now, let's continue.
<think>Next, we need to calculate how much money Tom has left after spending $4 in the first week. We start with the full allowance of $12 and subtract the $4 he spent: $12 - $4 = $8. So Tom has $8 left after the first week. </think>
Now, let's continue.
<think>Then, we need to calculate how much money Tom spends in the second week. He spends a quarter of what he has left after the first week. To find a quarter of $8, we divide $8 by 4: $8 / 4 = $2. So Tom spends $2 in the second week. </think>
Now, let's continue.
<think>Finally, we need to calculate how much money Tom has left after spending $2 in the second week. We take the amount he had left after the first week ($8) and subtract the $2 he spent: $8 - $2 = $6. So Tom has $6 left to finish the month. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate how much money Tom has after the first week. Since he spends a third of his allowance, we can find out how much he spends by dividing his allowance by 3:
Money spent in the first week = $12 / 3
Money spent in the first week = $4
Now, let's find out how much money he has left after the first week by subtracting the money he spent from his initial allowance:
Money left after the first week = $12 - $4
Money left after the first week = $8
Next, let's calculate how much money Tom spends in the second week. Since he spends a quarter of what he has left, we can find out how much he spends by dividing his remaining money by 4:
Money spent in the second week = $8 / 4
Money spent in the second week = $2
Now, let's find out how much money he has left after the second week by subtracting the money he spent from his remaining money:
Money left after the second week = $8 - $2

New Length = Original Length - (Original Length * Percentage Shorter)

In this case, the percentage shorter is 30%, which can also be written as 0.3 (since 30% is equivalent to 0.3 in decimal form). So, we have:

New Length = 20 - (20 * 0.3)

Now, let's calculate the value inside the parentheses first:

20 * 0.3 = 6

Then, subtract this value from the original length:

20 - 6 = 14

So, the pole is 14 meters long after being cut. </think>

To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we add up the total number of leaves that fell (7 leaves + 8 leaves) and divide by the total number of hours (1 hour + 2 hours), which gives us 15 leaves / 3 hours = 5 leaves per hour.

S + J = 120 (combined height)
J = 2S + 6 (Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height)
We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate S.
J = 2S + 6
J = 2(S + 6 - 6) + 6
J = 2S + 6
Now substitute J = 2S + 6 into S + J = 120:
S + (2S + 6) = 120
3S + 6 = 120
3S = 114
S = 38 inches (Sara's height)
Then, we can substitute S = 38 inches into the equation for J:
J = 2S + 6
J = 2(38) + 6
J = 76 + 6
J = 82 inches (Joe's height) </think>

🤖 Output: <think>Let's define some variables to represent Sara's and Joe's heights. We can call Sara's height S and Joe's height J.

We know from the problem statement that:
1. Sara and Joe's combined height is 120 inches. This can be represented as:
S + J = 120

2. Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height. This can be represented as:
J = 2S + 6

Now we have two equations:
1. S + J = 120
2. J = 2S + 6

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S:
S + (2S + 6) = 120
3S + 6 = 120

Now we can solve for S:
3S = 114
S = 38

Now that we know Sara's height, we can use the second equation to find Joe's height:
J = 2S + 6
J = 2(38) + 6
J = 76 + 6
J = 82

So, Joe is 82 inches tall. 🎉

We also know that Joe's height is 6 inches more than double Sara's height. This can be written as:
J = 2S + 6
Now we have two equations:
J + S = 120
J = 2S + 6
We can solve this system of equations by first solving the second equation for J and then substituting that result into the first equation. Then we'll solve for S.
If we substitute the expression for J from the second equation into the first equation:
Simplified version: S + (2S + 6) = 120 </think>
<think> Combining like terms gives us:
3S + 6 = 120
Next, we want to isolate S. We do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:
3S = 114
Finally, we divide both sides by 3:
S = 38
Now that we have Sara's height, we can find Joe's height using the equation J = 2S + 6:
J = 2 * 38 + 6
J = 76 + 6
J = 82
So Joe is 82 inches tall. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>1. We can start by setting up an equation to represent the information given in the problem.

Let Sara's height be x inches. Therefore, Joe's height would be (2x + 6) inches.

2. The problem states that Sara and Joe have a combined height of 120 inches. We can use this information to set up an equation: x + (2x + 6) = 120.

3. Now, we can simplify and solve the equation: 3x + 6 = 120.

4. Next, we can isolate x by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 114.

5. Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: x = 38.

6. Since Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height, Joe's height is 2x + 6. Plugging in the value of x, we get 2(38) + 6 = 82 inches.

7. Therefore, Joe is 82 inches tall, or 6 feet and 2 inches.

🤖 Output: <think> Let's define some variables to represent the unknowns:
- Let \( S \) be Sara's height.
- Let \( J \) be Joe's height.
According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( S + J = 120 \) (since they have a combined height of 120 inches).
2. \( J = 2S + 6 \) (since Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height).
Now we can use these equations to solve for \( S \) and \( J \).

First, substitute the value of \( J \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (2S + 6) = 120 \]
\[ 3S + 6 = 120 \]
\[ 3S = 114 \]
\[ S = 38 \]

Now that we have Sara's height, we can find Joe's height by substituting back into the second equation:
\[ J = 2(38) + 6 \]
\[ J = 76 + 6 \]
\[ J = 82 \]

So, Joe is 82 inches tall.

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's set up an equation based on the information given. If we represent Sara's height as S and Joe's height as J, we know two things:

1. The combined height is 120 inches.
2. Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height (which can be written as 2S + 6).

So, our equations look like this:
1. S + J = 120
2. J = 2S + 6

Now, we can use the first equation to express J in terms of S: J = 120 - S.
We can then substitute this expression for J into the second equation:

120 - S = 2S + 6

Now, it's time to solve for S. Let's isolate S on one side of the equation:

- S - 2S = 6 - 120

Combining like terms gives us:

-3S = -114

Dividing both sides by -3 will give us Sara's height:

S = 38

Now that we have Sara's height, we can easily find Joe's height using the second equation:

J = 2S + 6 = 2 * 38 + 6 = 76 + 6 = 82

S + (2S + 6) = 120

Now we can solve for S.

Joe is 82 inches tall. But let's verify:

Sara's height (S) + Joe's height (2S + 6) = 38 + (2 * 38 + 6) = 38 + (76 + 6) = 38 + 82 = 120 inches.

s + (2s + 6) = 120

Combine the terms:
3s + 6 = 120

Move the constant term to the right side:
3s = 120 - 6
3s = 114

Divide by the coefficient of s:
s = 114 / 3
s = 38

Now that we have Sara's height (s = 38 inches), we can find Joe's height (j = 2s + 6):
j = 2(38) + 6
j = 76 + 6
j = 82

Joe's height is 82 inches.

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's define variables to represent Sara's and Joe's heights. Let S be Sara's height and J be Joe's height. We have two equations based on the information given:
1. S + J = 120 (combined height)
2. J = 2S + 6 (Joe's height is 6 inches more than double Sara's height)

We can solve these equations to find the values of S and J. We'll substitute the second equation into the first equation to find Sara's height:
S + (2S + 6) = 120
Combine like terms:
3S + 6 = 120
Subtract 6 from both sides:
3S = 114
Divide by 3:
S = 38
Now that we know Sara's height, we can calculate Joe's height using the second equation:
J = 2S + 6
J = 2(38) + 6
J = 76 + 6
J = 82
So, Joe is 82 inches tall. </think>

John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5 feet
Substituting John's pool depth with 15 feet, we get:
15 = 2S + 5
Now, we will isolate S by following these steps:
1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:
15 - 5 = 2S
10 = 2S
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for S:
10 / 2 = S
S = 5
So, Sarah's pool depth is 5 feet. </think>

Therefore, 2x (which represents 2 times Sarah's pool depth) plus 5 (which represents the additional 5 feet) should equal 15 feet. So we have the equation 2x + 5 = 15. We need to solve for x (which represents the depth of Sarah's pool).

First, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:
2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
2x = 10

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:
2x / 2 = 10 / 2
x = 5

So, Sarah's pool is 5 feet deep. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> We need to find the depth of Sarah's pool, which we can call 's'. According to the problem, John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool, and we know that John's pool is 15 feet deep. So, we can write this as:
15 = 2s + 5
Now, we need to isolate s on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
15 - 5 = 2s
10 = 2s
Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for s:

🤖 Output: <think> We need to find the depth of Sarah's pool, which we can call 's'. According to the problem, John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool, and we know that John's pool is 15 feet deep. So, we can write this as:
15 = 2s + 5
Now, we need to isolate s on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
15 - 5 = 2s
10 = 2s
Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for s:
10 / 2 = s
s = 5 </think>
That means Sarah's pool is 5 feet deep.

Let's denote the depth of Sarah's pool as S. According to the problem, John's pool is 15 feet deep, so we can write the equation:

15 = 2 * S + 5

Now, let's solve this equation for S. First, we'll subtract 5 from both sides:

15 - 5 = 2 * S
10 = 2 * S

Now, we'll divide both sides by 2:

10 / 2 = S
5 = S

So, the depth of Sarah's pool is 5 feet. 🐼 </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's translate the given information into a mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the depths of John's and Sarah's pools. We know that John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool. We can represent this as:
John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5

Next, we need to use the information that John's pool is 15 feet deep. We can substitute this value into the equation:
15 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5

Now, let's solve for Sarah's pool depth. To do this, we'll first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
15 - 5 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth

This simplifies to:
10 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate Sarah's pool depth:
10 / 2 = Sarah's pool depth

This simplifies to:
5 = Sarah's pool depth

So, Sarah's pool depth is 5 feet. </think>

🎯 Target: 5
------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------
🤖 Output: <think> First, let's translate the given information into a mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the depths of John's and Sarah's pools. We know that John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool. We can represent this as:
John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5

Next, we need to use the information that John's pool is 15 feet deep. We can substitute this value into the equation:
15 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5

Now, let's solve for Sarah's pool depth. To do this, we'll first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
15 - 5 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth

This simplifies to:
10 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate Sarah's pool depth:
10 / 2 = Sarah's pool depth

This simplifies to:
5 = Sarah's pool depth

So, Sarah's pool depth is 5 feet. </think>
<answer> 5 </answer>

🎯 Target: 5
------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------
🤖 Output: <think> First, let's translate the given information into a mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the depths of John's and Sarah's pools. We know that John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool. We can represent this as:
John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5

Next, we need to use the information that John's pool is 15 feet deep. We can substitute this value into the equation:
15 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5

Now, let's solve for Sarah's pool depth. To do this, we'll first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
15 - 5 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth

This simplifies to:
10 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate Sarah's pool depth:
10 / 2 = Sarah's pool depth

This simplifies to:
5 = Sarah's pool depth

So, Sarah's pool depth is 5 feet. </think>
<answer> 5 </answer>

🤖 Output: <think> We know that John's pool is 15 feet deep and is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool. Let's represent the depth of Sarah's pool as "S". According to the information given:
John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5
15 = 2S + 5

Now, we will solve the equation for S. First, let's subtract 5 from both sides:
15 - 5 = 2S + 5 - 5
10 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to find the value of S:
10/2 = 2S/2
5 = S

So, Sarah's pool is 5 feet deep.

🤖 Output: <think>Let's define some variables. Let x be the depth of Sarah's pool, and y be the depth of John's pool. We know two things:

1. John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah’s pool: y = 2x + 5

2. John’s pool is 15 feet deep: y = 15

We can use the first equation and substitute the value for y from the second equation to solve for x (the depth of Sarah's pool).

So, we have:

15 = 2x + 5

First, subtract 5 from both sides:

15 - 5 = 2x

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's translate the statement into an equation. "John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool" can be written as:
John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5 feet</think>
Now, we know that John's pool is 15 feet deep. So, we plug in this value for John's pool depth:
15 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5</think>
Next, we need to solve for Sarah's pool depth. To do this, we'll first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
10 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth</think>
Then, we'll divide both sides by 2:
5 = Sarah's pool depth</think>
So Sarah's pool depth is 5 feet deep. <answer> 5 </answer>

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's define the variables we know and need to find. We'll use 'J' for John's pool depth and 'S' for Sarah's pool depth.
We're given that John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool, so that's our equation: J = 2S + 5.
We're also given that John's pool is 15 feet deep, so we can plug this in and find Sarah's pool depth:
15 = 2S + 5
Now, we'll subtract 5 from both sides to isolate '2S':
15 - 5 = 2S
10 = 2S
Next, we'll divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 'S':
10 / 2 = S
S = 5
Therefore, Sarah's pool is 5 feet deep.</think>

$30 (price of shoes) * 90% (refund percentage) = $27.
Subtract the refund amount from his initial money to find out how much he has left after returning the shoes: $24 (remaining money) + $27 (refund) = $51. Will has $51 left. <endthink>

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to find out how much money Will spent on the sweater, T-shirt, and shoes before returning the shoes. He spent $9 on the sweater and $11 on the T-shirt, so the total spent without the shoes is 9 + 11 = $20. Then, he bought a pair of shoes for $30. Adding these together, his total spending was $20 + $30 = $50. 

Now to calculate the refund from returning the shoes. We know that he got a 90% refund. So, the refund amount is 90% of the cost of the shoes. To find this, we perform the calculation: 
30 * 0.9 = 27. This means Will got a $27 refund.

Now, we subtract the refund from the initial amount he received from his mom, which initially was $74 but he spent $50. 
74 - (spent on items) = 74 - 50 = $24.

Adding these together, his total spending was $20 + $30 = $50. 

Now to calculate the refund from returning the shoes. We know that he got a 90% refund. So, the refund amount is 90% of the cost of the shoes. To find this, we perform the calculation: 
30 * 0.9 = 27. This means Will got a $27 refund.

Now, we subtract the refund from the initial amount he received from his mom, which initially was $74 but he spent $50. 
74 - (spent on items) = 74 - 50 = $24. 

However, he then got a refund of $27, so we add this to what he has left:
24 + 27 = $51. </think>

$$9 + 11 + 30 = 50$$

Now, let's calculate the refund for the shoes. Since he returned $30 and received a 90% refund, he got back 90/100 * $30 = $27.

So, the amount remaining after the refund is:
$$50 - 27 = 23$$

Now, let's calculate how much Will spends after the refund. He doesn't spend any more money on new items, so he only spends his remaining amount:

🤖 Output: <think>1) First, let's calculate how much water the first two tanks need.
Since each of these tanks requires 8 gallons, their total usage is 2 x 8 = 16 gallons.
2) Next, let's determine the water requirement for the other two tanks.
We know that these tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two tanks. So, each of these tanks requires 8 - 2 = 6 gallons of water.
Since there are two such tanks, their total usage is 2 x 6 = 12 gallons.
3) Now, let's find the combined water requirement for all four tanks.
This is simply the sum of the water requirements from steps 1 and 2.
Total water requirement = 16 gallons (from step 1) + 12 gallons (from step 2) = 28 gallons.
4) Finally, let's calculate the total water needed for 4 weeks.
Since Nicole changes the water once a week, for 4 weeks she will need 4 x 28 gallons = 112 gallons of water.

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for each type of tank:
- The first two tanks need 8 gallons each.
- The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two, meaning they need 8 - 2 = 6 gallons each.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water needed for each week:
- Total water for first two tanks: 8 gallons + 8 gallons = 16 gallons.
- Total water for last two tanks: 6 gallons + 6 gallons = 12 gallons.
- Total water for all tanks in a week: 16 gallons + 12 gallons = 28 gallons.

Since Nicole needs to change the water weekly for four weeks, we multiply the weekly amount by four:
28 gallons * 4 = 112 gallons. </think>
<answer> 112 </answer> gallons of water will Nicole need in four weeks.

🤖 Output: <think> First, we need to determine how much water each of the four tanks requires initially:
- For the first two tanks: Each tank needs 8 gallons. So, 2 tanks * 8 gallons = 16 gallons.
- For the other two tanks: Each tank needs 2 gallons less than the first two tanks. So, 8 gallons - 2 gallons = 6 gallons. Each tank thus needs 6 gallons. Therefore, 2 tanks * 6 gallons = 12 gallons.
- Total water needed each week = 16 gallons (for the first two tanks) + 12 gallons (for the other two tanks) = 28 gallons.
- To find out how much water is needed in four weeks, we simply multiply the weekly water usage by 4 weeks.
    28 gallons/week * 4 weeks = 112 gallons.

2. Two of the tanks need 8 gallons each.
3. The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons.
4. We need to find out how much water Nicole will need in four weeks.

First, let's calculate how much water the first two tanks require:
- Each of these tanks needs 8 gallons of water.
- So, for both tanks combined, they need 8 + 8 = 16 gallons of water per week.

Next, let's find out how much water the other two tanks need:

Now, let's add up the weekly water requirements for all four tanks:
- The first two tanks together need 16 gallons.
- The other two tanks together need 12 gallons.
- Therefore, Nicole needs 16 + 12 = 28 gallons of water per week to fill all four tanks.

Each of these tanks needs 2 fewer gallons than the first two tanks, which are 8 gallons each. So each of these tanks needs 8 - 2 = 6 gallons of water.
Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for all four tanks:
- First two tanks: 8 + 8 = 16 gallons
- Last two tanks: 6 + 6 = 12 gallons
Total needed for all four tanks: 16 + 12 = 28 gallons.
Since Nicole changes the water every week, we need to find out how much water she uses in four weeks:
28 gallons/week * 4 weeks = 112 gallons.
So, Nicole will need 112 gallons of water in four weeks. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> Nicole has two tanks that need 8 gallons each, so 2 tanks * 8 gallons = 16 gallons. The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two tanks, so 8 gallons - 2 gallons = 6 gallons for each of these two tanks. Thus, the other two tanks together need 6 gallons + 6 gallons = 12 gallons. </think>
Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for all four tanks in one week.
<notice> We already know that the first two tanks need 16 gallons in total, and the other two tanks need 12 gallons in total. So, the total is 16 gallons + 12 gallons = 28 gallons for all four tanks in one week. </notice>
Since Nicole cleans the tanks every week, we need to find out how much water she would need in four weeks.
<notice> To calculate the total amount of water needed in four weeks, we simply multiply the weekly amount by four: 28 gallons * 4 weeks = 112 gallons. </notice>
So, Nicole will need 112 gallons of water in four weeks.
<answer> 112 </answer>

>#WHY
Because Nicole decides to clean her aquariums every week, the total water needed will be the weekly water requirement multiplied by the number of weeks.

🤖 Output: <think> First, we calculate the amount of water needed for the first two tanks:
8 gallons/tank * 2 tanks = 16 gallons

Next, we find out how much water the other two tanks require. Since they need 2 fewer gallons each than the first two tanks:
(8 - 2) gallons/tank * 2 tanks = 12 gallons

Now, let's add up all the water needed for the four tanks:
First two tanks: 16 gallons
Other two tanks: 12 gallons
Total water needed per week: 16 gallons + 12 gallons = 28 gallons

Finally, we calculate the amount of water Nicole will need in four weeks:
Total water needed per week * Number of weeks = 28 gallons/week * 4 weeks = 112 gallons

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for each type of tank.
The first two tanks need 8 gallons each, so for two tanks that's 8 * 2 = 16 gallons.
The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two tanks, so they need 8 - 2 = 6 gallons each.
For the other two tanks, that would be 6 * 2 = 12 gallons.
So, in total, Nicole needs 16 + 12 = 28 gallons of water for the four tanks initially.
Now, we know that Nicole needs to change the water every week, which means after four weeks she will have used 28 * 4 = 112 gallons of water.</think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for each type of tank.
The first two tanks need 8 gallons each, so for two tanks that's 8 * 2 = 16 gallons.
The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two tanks, so they need 8 - 2 = 6 gallons each.
For the other two tanks, that would be 6 * 2 = 12 gallons.
So, in total, Nicole needs 16 + 12 = 28 gallons of water for the four tanks initially.
Now, we know that Nicole needs to change the water every week, which means after four weeks she will have used 28 * 4 = 112 gallons of water.</think>

1. There are 4 fish tanks.
2. The first two tanks need 8 gallons of water each.
3. The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons of water each than the first two tanks.
4. Nicole needs to change the water every week for 4 weeks.
Now, let's calculate the amount of water needed for the other two tanks:
- For the third tank: 8 gallons - 2 gallons = 6 gallons
- For the fourth tank: 8 gallons - 2 gallons = 6 gallons
Next, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for all four tanks:
- For the first two tanks: 2 tanks * 8 gallons/tank = 16 gallons
- For the other two tanks: 2 tanks * 6 gallons/tank = 12 gallons
- Total amount of water: 16 gallons + 12 gallons = 28 gallons
Now, to find out how much water Nicole will need in four weeks, we multiply the total amount of water needed (28 gallons) by the number of weeks she plans to change the water (4 weeks):
- Total amount of water needed in four weeks: 28 gallons/week * 4 weeks = 112 gallons. </think>

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for each set of fish tanks.</think>
- The first two tanks need 8 gallons each. So, for both tanks, they together need \(8 + 8 = 16\) gallons.
- The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two. Therefore, each of these tanks need \(8 - 2 = 6\) gallons.
- So, for these two tanks, they need \(6 + 6 = 12\) gallons in total.

Now, we add up the water needed for all four tanks:
- First tanks: 16 gallons
- Second tanks: 12 gallons

Total water needed for all tanks in one week:
\[ 16 + 12 = 28 \text{ gallons} \]

Since Nicole needs to change the water every week and there are four weeks, we multiply the weekly usage by 4:
\[ 28 \times 4 = 112 \text{ gallons} \]

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for each set of fish tanks.</think>
- The first two tanks need 8 gallons each. So, for both tanks, they together need \(8 + 8 = 16\) gallons.
- The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons than the first two. Therefore, each of these tanks need \(8 - 2 = 6\) gallons.
- So, for these two tanks, they need \(6 + 6 = 12\) gallons in total.

Now, we add up the water needed for all four tanks:
- First tanks: 16 gallons
- Second tanks: 12 gallons

Total water needed for all tanks in one week:
\[ 16 + 12 = 28 \text{ gallons} \]

Since Nicole needs to change the water every week and there are four weeks, we multiply the weekly usage by 4:
\[ 28 \times 4 = 112 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total number of gallons of water needed in four weeks is <answer> 112 </answer>.

🤖 Output: <think>First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for each type of tank:
For the first two tanks, each tank requires 8 gallons. So, the total amount of water for these two tanks is 8 gallons + 8 gallons = 16 gallons.
For the other two tanks, each tank requires 2 gallons less than the first two tanks. Therefore, each of these tanks requires 8 gallons - 2 gallons = 6 gallons of water.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for all four tanks:
Total water = (water for the first two tanks) + (water for the other two tanks)
Total water = 16 gallons + (6 gallons + 6 gallons) = 16 gallons + 12 gallons = 28 gallons.

Finally, since Nicole needs to change the water every week for four weeks, she will need a total of:
Total water (for four weeks) = Total water per week × 4
Total water (for four weeks) = 28 gallons/week × 4 weeks = 112 gallons. </think>

🤖 Output: <think> First, we know that all 20 sheep, 10 cows, and 14 dogs were on the boat. Then 3 sheep drowned but survived because they made it to the shore.
So, we must start by calculating how many sheep made it to shore:
20 sheep - 3 sheep that drowned = 17 sheep that made it to shore
Now, focus on the cows. Twice as many cows drowned as drowned sheep. Since 3 sheep drowned, twice that amount for the cows is:
2 times 3 sheep = 6 cows that drowned
Next, we calculate how many cows remained alive:
10 cows - 6 cows that drowned = 4 cows that made it to shore
All dogs managed to escape, which means all 14 dogs made it to shore.
Now, we sum up the number of animals that made it to shore:
17 sheep that made it to shore + 4 cows that made it to shore + 14 dogs that made it to shore.

🤖 Output: <think> First, let's determine the number of sheep and cows that drowned. There were twice as many cows that drowned as there were sheep. We know that 3 sheep drowned, so 3 x 2 = 6 cows drowned. </think>

Now, let's calculate the number of surviving animals.
<think> We have 20 - 3 = 17 sheep who made it to the shore. Likewise, we have 10 - 6 = 4 cows that made it to the shore. </think>

Finally, let's calculate the total number of animals that survived.
<think> 17 + 4 + 14 = 35 animals made it to the shore. </think>

So the final answer is:

3. Twice as many cows drowned as sheep, so 2 * 3 = 6 cows drowned.
4. All dogs made it to shore, so all 14 dogs went to shore.
5. To find out how many total animals made it to shore, we subtract the drowned animals from the initial counts and add the saved animals together. </think>

Now, let's calculate:
1. Initial sheep: 20
   After 3 drowned: 20 - 3 = 17
2. Initial cows: 10
   After 6 drowned: 10 - 6 = 4
3. Initial dogs: 14
   All dogs made it to shore: +14

Adding these together:
17 (remaining sheep) + 4 (remaining cows) + 14 (dogs) = 35
So, the number of total animals that made it to the shore is 35.

Step 2: Calculate how many animals drowned in total.
We know that 3 sheep drowned and 6 cows drowned, so a total of 3 + 6 = 9 animals drowned.
Step 3: Calculate how many animals made it to the shore.
We know that 20 sheep were on the boat, and 3 drowned, so 20 - 3 = 17 sheep made it to the shore.
We know that 10 cows were on the boat, and 6 drowned, so 10 - 6 = 4 cows made it to the shore.
All of the dogs made it to shore, so 14 dogs made it to the shore.
In total, 17 + 4 + 14 = 35 animals made it to the shore.

There are 11 families that received decorations and one additional box was given to the community center. So, the total number of families is:
11 families + 1 community center = 12 families

<think>Step 2: Calculate the total number of decorations given to each family.</think>
Each family received a box containing:
- 4 pieces of tinsel
- 1 Christmas tree
- 5 snow globes

So, the total number of decorations per family is:
4 tinsel + 1 tree + 5 snow globes = 10 decorations

<think>Step 3: Calculate the total number of decorations handed out.</think>
Now, we can calculate the total number of decorations given out by multiplying the total number of families (12) by the number of decorations each family received (10):
12 families × 10 decorations/family = 120 decorations

Find the missing number in the series above (it's not 100). Show your work and explain how you figured it out.
To find the missing number in the series, let's first examine the pattern and calculate the differences between adjacent numbers.

108 - 104 = 4
104 - 101 = 3
101 - 99 = 2
99 - 96 = 3
96 - 93 = 3

There doesn't seem to be a fixed pattern in the differences, but we can observe some repetition in the numbers that appear more than once.

104, 99, 96

Let's analyze these numbers. They all end in either 4 or 9, and when you subtract one from the other, you get a 3 in the middle:

99 - 104 = -5, which is not helpful.
96 - 99 = -3, which is helpful.

Now let's look at how the 3 number appears repeatedly:

101 - 99 = 2 (This doesn't help)
99 - 96 = 3 (Helpful)

So, we see that the '3' is being used twice: once between 99 and 96, and again between 96 and the next number.

Let's determine the next number by subtracting 3 from 96:

96 - 3 = 93

However, 93 doesn't match any of the given options. It appears that there might be something else at play here. Let's revisit the initial numbers (108, 104, 101, etc.) and look for a pattern involving the given numbers 108, 104, and 101.

We can try adding 3 to each of these numbers and see if we can deduce a sequence:

108 + 3 = 111
104 - 3 = 101
101 + 3 = 104

Now, let's look at the option 120 and see if we can find a connection. If we look at the numbers 120 and 111, we can see that 111 is close to the first number in our subsequence (101). So, let's try to find a connection between 108, 104, and 101 to 120.

108 - 3 = 105
105 + 2 = 107
107 + 3 = 110
110 + 2 = 112
112 + 3 = 115
115 - 3 = 112 (which is close, but not 120)

Now, let's try subtracting 3 from each of these numbers:

111 - 3 = 108
104 + 2 = 106
101 + 3 = 104
98 + 3 = 101 (which is close, but not 120)

After trying different combinations, it seems like there's no straightforward pattern. However, since the problem states that the missing number is not 100, 101, or 104, with the given numbers and operations, the missing number should be 110.

So, the answer is 110.

108 + 3 = 111
104 - 3 = 101
101 + 3 = 104

Now, let's look at the option 120 and see if we can find a connection. If we look at the numbers 120 and 111, we can see that 111 is close to the first number in our subsequence (101). So, let's try to find a connection between 108, 104, and 101 to 120.

108 - 3 = 105
105 + 2 = 107
107 + 3 = 110
110 + 2 = 112
112 + 3 = 115
115 - 3 = 112 (which is close, but not 120)

Now, let's try subtracting 3 from each of these numbers:

111 - 3 = 108
104 + 2 = 106
101 + 3 = 104
98 + 3 = 101 (which is close, but not 120)

After trying different combinations, it seems like there's no straightforward pattern. However, since the problem states that the missing number is not 100, 101, or 104, with the given numbers and operations, the missing number should be 110.

So, the answer is 110.

🤖 Output: <think> Step 1: Calculate the total number of decorations per box.
There are 4 tinsels, 1 Christmas tree, and 5 snow globes in each box, so the total number of decorations per box is:
4 tinsels + 1 Christmas tree + 5 snow globes = 10 decorations

Step 2: Calculate the total number of decorations given out to the families.
There are 11 families receiving a box of decorations, so the total number of decorations given to these families is:
11 families * 10 decorations per family = 110 decorations

Step 3: Calculate the total number of decorations given out.

Find the missing number in the series above (it's not 100). Show your work and explain how you figured it out.
To find the missing number in the series, let's first examine the pattern and calculate the differences between adjacent numbers.

108 - 104 = 4
104 - 101 = 3
101 - 99 = 2
99 - 96 = 3
96 - 93 = 3

There doesn't seem to be a fixed pattern in the differences, but we can observe some repetition in the numbers that appear more than once.

104, 99, 96

Let's analyze these numbers. They all end in either 4 or 9, and when you subtract one from the other, you get a 3 in the middle:

99 - 104 = -5, which is not helpful.
96 - 99 = -3, which is helpful.

Now let's look at how the 3 number appears repeatedly:

101 - 99 = 2 (This doesn't help)
99 - 96 = 3 (Helpful)

So, we see that the '3' is being used twice: once between 99 and 96, and again between 96 and the next number.

Let's determine the next number by subtracting 3 from 96:

96 - 3 = 93

However, 93 doesn't match any of the given options. It appears that there might be something else at play here. Let's revisit the initial numbers (108, 104, 101, etc.) and look for a pattern involving the given numbers 108, 104, and 101.

110 + 2 = 112
112 + 3 = 115
115 - 3 = 112 (which is close, but not 120)

Now, let's try subtracting 3 from each of these numbers:

111 - 3 = 108
104 + 2 = 106
101 + 3 = 104
